0x08. C# - Inheritance

0. This is one of these mandatory
Write a method that returns True if the object is an int, otherwise return False.

1. For instance mandatory
Write a method that returns True if the object is an instance of, or if the object is an instance of a class that inherited from, Array, otherwise return False.

2. Only subclass mandatory
Write a method that returns True if the object is an instance of a class that inherits from the specified class, otherwise return False. The object must be a subclass; your method cannot return True if the object is an instance of the base class.

3. Type mandatory
Write a method that prints the names of the available properties and methods of an object. See example for output format.

4. It's not a lesson in classes and inheritance without a Dog mandatory
Write a empty class Dog that inherits from empty class Animal.

5. Basic shapes mandatory

8. Square #1 mandatory
Based on 7-shape, write a class Square that inherits from Rectangle.

9. Square #2 mandatory

10. Liskov mandatory
Write a blog post that explains the problem with implementing a Square class as a derived class of Rectangle. It should cover:

 - what Liskovâ€™s substitution principle is
 - why Square inheriting from Rectangle is not an ideal design choice
 - ways that this class hierarchy could be improved
